# Enhancing Requirement Traceability through Data Augmentation Using Large Language Models

This repository contains the experimental code for the paper **"Synergistic Enhancement of Requirement-to-Code Traceability: A Framework Combining Large Language Model based Data Augmentation and an Advanced Encoder"**. The experiments demonstrate how data augmentation techniques can be used to enhance requirement traceability using large language models.

## Repository Structure

- **code/**: Contains the source code for data augmentation and requirement traceability experiments.
- **datasets/**: Includes the datasets used for training and evaluation of the requirement traceability models.
- **evaluate/**: Contains evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the models.
- **result/**: Includes the output results, such as model predictions, metrics, and analysis.

## Running Environment

The experiments can be conducted in both local Windows machines and Kaggle cloud servers.

We recommend the Python programming environment as follows:

- Anaconda 3.X
- Jupyter-lab
- Python 3.X
- Scikit-learn
- transformers
- Kaggle OR Google Colab
